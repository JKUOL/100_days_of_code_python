# Snake Game README

## Introduction
This Python script is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game. It utilizes the `turtle` module for graphics and handling keypress events. The snake can be controlled with the arrow keys, and the game continues until the player chooses to exit by clicking on the game window.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface**: Uses the `turtle` module for creating the game window and snake.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Allows the player to control the snake's direction using the arrow keys.
- **Game Loop**: The game runs in a loop, constantly checking for user input and updating the snake's position.

## Requirements
- **Python**: Python must be installed to run the script.
- **Turtle Module**: The `turtle` module must be available in your Python environment.
- **Snake Module**: A separate module named `day_20_snake` which contains the `Snake` class definition.

## Installation
Ensure Python and the turtle module are installed. Place the snake game script and the `day_20_snake` module in the same directory.

## Usage
1. Run the script in a Python environment that supports the `turtle` module.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
3. To exit the game, click on the game window.

## Customizing the Game
- Modify `STARTING_POSITIONS` in the `day_20_snake` module to change the initial length and position of the snake.
- Adjust `MOVE_DISTANCE` to increase or decrease the snake's speed.
- Change the `screen.bgcolor` to customize the background color of the game screen.

## Educational Value
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Demonstrates the use of classes and objects in Python.
- **Game Development**: Introduces basic concepts of game development, like game loops and handling user input.
- **Python Turtle Graphics**: Offers practice with Python's turtle graphics library for simple game creation.
