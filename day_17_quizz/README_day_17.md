# Python Quiz Game Program README

## Introduction
This Python program simulates a simple quiz game using an object-oriented programming approach. It features classes for creating questions, managing the quiz flow, and tracking user interactions. Users can answer true/false questions prompted in the command line, and the program provides feedback and score tracking.

## Features
- **Class `Question`**: Constructs a question object with the text and the correct answer.
- **Class `QuizBrain`**: Manages the quiz logic, including prompting questions to the user, checking answers, and keeping score.
- **Class `User`**: Represents a user profile within the game, with the ability to follow other users and be followed.
- **Interactive Quiz**: Users interact with the quiz through the command line, answering questions with 'True' or 'False'.
- **Score Tracking**: After each question, the program updates and displays the user's score.
- **User Following System**: The program allows 'User' objects to follow each other, mimicking a simple social network interaction.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: Requires Python 3.x to run as it uses the latest features of object-oriented programming.
- **Basic Command Line Knowledge**: Users should be able to navigate and run commands in the command line.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository containing the source code.
2. Ensure the Python files (`day_17_question_model.py`, `day_17_data.py`, `day_17_quiz_brain.py`, `clear_function.py`) are in the same directory.

## Usage
1. Run the main script in your Python environment.
2. Answer the true/false questions as they appear in the command line.
3. Your ongoing score will be displayed after each question.
4. The total score is presented at the end of the quiz.

## Educational Value
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Demonstrates the use of OOP in creating interactive applications.
- **User Input Handling**: Shows how to handle and validate user inputs.
- **Conditional Logic**: Uses conditional logic to determine correct answers and manage game flow.
- **Data Management**: Highlights how to manage and use data in a program, including storing questions and tracking user interactions.
