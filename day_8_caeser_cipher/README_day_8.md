# Caesar Cipher
This Python script is an implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features
Encryption and Decryption: Allows the user to encode or decode a message by shifting letters.

Custom Shift Value: Users can specify the magnitude of the shift for the cipher.

Input Validation: Ensures that the user selects a valid option for encoding or decoding.

Continuous Use: Lets the user run the program multiple times without restarting.

## Requirements
Python: This script is written in Python and requires Python to be installed on your system. It is compatible with Python 3.x.

Operating System: This script is designed to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

## Instructions

Save the script as caesar_cipher.py on your computer.
Open your terminal or command line interface.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script by typing python caesar_cipher.py and press Enter.
Follow the on-screen prompts to either encode or decode a message.
Enter the shift number when prompted.
Choose to run the program again or exit after the operation completes.

## Educational Value
This script offers a practical application for understanding:

String Manipulation: Working with strings to implement the cipher algorithm.

Loops: Utilizing while loops for continuous operation and input validation.

Modular Programming: Defining and calling functions with parameters.

Control Flow: Implementing conditional statements to handle user choices and flow of the program.
