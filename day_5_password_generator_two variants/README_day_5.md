# Password Generator
This Python script is a user-friendly tool designed to create a secure and random password based on user preferences for letters, symbols, and numbers.

## How It Works
The script proceeds through the following steps:

### Welcome Message:

Greets the user and introduces the purpose of the script.

### User Input Collection:

Asks the user for the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers in the password.

### Password Components Creation:

Generates lists for lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special German characters (Umlaute), symbols, and numbers.

### Password Assembly:

Randomly selects the specified number of characters from each list and compiles them into a list of potential password components.

### Password Finalization:

Shuffles the list of components to ensure randomness and then concatenates them into a single string to form the final password.

### Password Output:

Displays the newly generated password to the user.

## Educational Value
Through examining and utilizing this script, learners can gain insights into several Python concepts:

### Data Type Conversion:

Shows how to convert integers to characters and how to transform elements of a list to strings.

### List Comprehensions:

Utilizes list comprehensions for concise and readable creation of lists.

### Randomization Techniques:

Demonstrates the use of the random module to select random items from a list.

### Looping Constructs:

Implements for or while loops (depending on script) to iterate a specific number of times, corresponding to the desired number of characters.

### String Manipulation:

Illustrates the process of building a string by joining a list of characters.
