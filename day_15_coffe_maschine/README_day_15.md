# Python Coffee Machine Program README

## Introduction
Experience the role of a barista with this Python-based coffee machine program. Engage in a virtual coffee shop environment where you can prepare espresso, latte, and cappuccino for your customers. This script offers a mix of resource management, basic accounting, and user interaction in a simple text-based interface.

## Features
- **Dynamic Menu**: Offers a selection of coffee drinks with varying ingredients and costs.
- **Resource Checking**: Ensures that the coffee machine has enough ingredients to make the chosen drink.
- **Coin Processing**: Calculates the total amount of money inserted by the customer.
- **Transaction Validation**: Checks if the customer has provided enough money for the drink.
- **Coffee Production**: Simulates the making of a coffee by updating the resources after each drink.

## Requirements
- **Python**: Requires Python to be installed, compatible with Python 3.x.
- **Operating System**: Can run on any operating system that supports Python, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Command Line Interface**: To interact with the program, access to a terminal or command prompt is needed.

## Instructions
1. Save the script as `day_15_coffee_machine.py` on your computer.
2. Ensure the `clear_function.py` is in the same directory as the main script.
3. Run the script.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select your coffee drink and process payment.
5. Use 'off' to turn off the machine, or 'report' to print the current resource levels and money earned.
6. If a drink is selected, follow the instructions to insert coins and complete the transaction.

## Educational Value
- **Python Dictionaries**: Demonstrates the use of dictionaries to store menu items and resources.
- **Control Flow**: Implements if-else statements for decision-making processes.
- **While Loops**: Uses while loops for the main execution of the program to handle continuous operation.
- **Function Definitions**: Showcases the creation and use of functions to perform specific tasks and keep the code organized.
- **Global Variables**: Utilizes global variables to track resources and profit within the scope of the program.
