# Treasure Island Game
This Python script is an interactive text-based adventure game that takes the player on a journey to find the elusive treasure on Treasure Island.

## How It Works
Upon execution, the game script guides the player through a series of events:

### Welcome and Introduction:

Begins with an ASCII art title for visual appeal.
Welcomes the player to the game and sets the scene for the adventure.

### Decision Making:

Prompts the player to make choices at various points, such as which direction to take or what actions to perform.
Each choice leads to different branches of the story, culminating in various outcomes.

### Consequences and Endings:

Based on the player's decisions, the script narrates the consequences, which may include waiting for a boat, encountering creatures, or finding treasure.
The game can end in multiple ways, depending on the paths taken by the player.

## Educational Value
The Treasure Island game script serves as a practical learning tool:

### Conditional Logic:

Demonstrates the use of if-else statements to create branching paths in a program.

### User Input and Processing:

Shows how to capture and handle user input to influence the flow of the game.

### ASCII Art Integration:

Utilizes ASCII art to visually represent story elements within a text-based environment.

### Creative Coding:

Encourages understanding the narrative flow in coding and how creative elements like storytelling can be integrated into programming.
