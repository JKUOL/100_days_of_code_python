# Python Number Guessing Game README

## Introduction
Dive into a fun and interactive Number Guessing Game where your intuition and luck can be tested against the computer. This Python script is a simple text-based game where you guess a randomly generated number within a range.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: Uses Python's `random` module to generate a secret number for the player to guess.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Players can choose between 'easy' and 'hard' levels, affecting the number of guesses allowed.
- **User Interaction**: The game provides prompts and feedback through the command line, engaging players each step of the way.
- **Replayability**: After each game, players can choose to play another round or exit the game.

## Requirements
- **Python**: Requires Python to be installed on your system, compatible with Python 3.x.
- **Operating System**: Can be run on any OS with Python support, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Command Line Interface**: Played in the terminal or command prompt.

## Instructions
1. Save the script as `day_12_number_guessing.py` on your system.
2. Open your terminal or command line interface.
3. Change the directory to where you saved the script.
4. Execute the script by typing `day_12_number_guessing.py` and hit Enter.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
6. Decide to continue with a new game or exit after each round.

## Educational Value
- **Number Generation**: Demonstrates the use of Python's `random` module.
- **Functions**: Showcases defining and calling Python functions for specific tasks.
- **Loops**: Utilizes both `while` and `for` loops for game logic and replayability.
- **Conditional Statements**: Implements `if-else` statements to provide game decision logic.

Step into the challenge of guessing games and enhance your Python skills with hands-on experience!
