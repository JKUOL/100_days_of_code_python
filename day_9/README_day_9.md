### First Price Sealed Auction

This Python script simulates a first-price sealed auction, where participants submit their bids secretly, and the highest bid wins. The winner is the one who offers the highest price, and they pay the amount of their bid.

## Features
Secret Bidding: Allows users to place their bids without knowing the bids of others.

Multiple Participants: The auction can handle multiple bidders.

Winner Calculation: Automatically calculates and announces the highest bidder and their bid amount.

## Requirements
Python: This script is written in Python and requires Python to be installed on your system. It is compatible with Python 3.x.

Operating System: This script is designed to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

Additional Files: This script imports a clear function from clear_function and a logo from day_9_art. Ensure these files are in the same directory as the main script.

## Instructions
Save the script as sealed_auction.py on your computer.
Ensure that the clear_function and day_9_art files are in the same directory.
Open your terminal or command line interface.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script by typing python sealed_auction.py and press Enter.
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter bidders' names and their bids.
Continue to enter bids as prompted or conclude the auction to see the result.

## Educational Value
This script is a practical demonstration of:

Dictionary Usage: Utilizes Python dictionaries to store bidder names and their corresponding bids.

Looping: Implements a while loop to continuously accept new bidders until the user decides to stop.

Function Definition: Demonstrates creating and using functions in Python.

User Input Handling: Processes and validates user inputs.

This sealed auction script offers a fun way to understand basic Python concepts and how they can be applied to create a functional application.
