# Blackjack Game
This Python script is a simple text-based version of the Blackjack game, also known as 21. The player competes against the "house" with the goal of achieving a hand value closer to 21 than the house without exceeding it.

## Features

Card Value Calculation: Assigns numerical values to card names and calculates the hand's total value.

Ace Adjustment: Adjusts the value of the Ace from 11 to 1 if the hand's total value exceeds 21.

House Rules: The house will continue to take cards until the total value is at least 16.

Game Outcomes: Determines and displays the outcome of the game (player win, house win, or bust).

## Requirements
Python: The script requires Python to be installed on your system. It is compatible with Python 3.x.

Operating System: This script can be run on any operating system that supports Python, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Command Line Interface: The game is played in the terminal or command prompt.

## Instructions

Save the script as blackjack.py on your computer.
Open your terminal or command line interface.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script by typing python blackjack.py and pressing Enter.
Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.
After each game, choose whether to play another round or to exit.

## Educational Value
This script demonstrates:

Random Selection: Uses the random module to simulate drawing cards from a deck.

Functions: Defines functions for calculating hand values and the game's logic.

Looping Constructs: Utilizes while loops for the gameplay and for loops for iterating over cards.

Conditional Logic: Implements if-else statements to handle the game's rules and logic.
