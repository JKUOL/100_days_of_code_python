# Turtle Race Game README

## Introduction
This script is a simple turtle race game created with Python's `turtle` module. Players can bet on a turtle color they believe will win the race. Once the race begins, each turtle moves forward random distances until one crosses the finish line.

## Features
- **Turtle Graphics**: Uses the `turtle` module to simulate a race with turtle graphics.
- **User Interaction**: Collects user bets through text input.
- **Random Movement**: Each turtle moves a random number of steps to simulate racing.

## Requirements
- **Python**: Python must be installed to run the script.
- **Turtle Module**: The `turtle` module must be available in your Python environment.
- **`clear_function` Module**: A custom module to clear the screen after the race ends.

## Installation
Ensure Python and the required modules are installed. No additional installation is needed for the script itself.

## Usage
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter your bet for the turtle color you think will win when prompted.
3. Watch the race unfold.
4. The script will clear the screen and announce the winner at the end of the race.
5. Click on the screen to close the program.

## Customizing the Game
- Adjust the `colors` list to change the turtles' colors.
- Modify the `screen.setup` width and height to change the screen size.
- Change the random distance range for turtle movement to alter race dynamics.

## Educational Value
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Learn how user input can affect the flow of the program.
- **Conditional Logic**: Understand how to use conditions to check for a win or loss.
- **Loops and Iteration**: Experience how loops can be used to simulate real-time events like a race.
