# Turtle Random Damien Hirst Art Simulator README

## Introduction
This Python script utilizes the turtle graphics library to create a random dot painting. By using the `turtle` module and the `random` module, the script generates a canvas of colorful dots, creating an abstract piece of art with random colors.

## Features
- **Random Color Generation**: Utilizes a function to generate random RGB color values.
- **Automated Drawing**: A turtle named Damien moves across the screen, drawing dots in a grid pattern.
- **Customization**: Variables are in place for easy adjustments of dot width and spacing.

## Requirements
- **Python**: Must have Python installed.
- **Turtle Graphics Library**: Ensure the `turtle` module is available in your Python environment.

## Usage
1. Run the script in a Python environment that supports turtle graphics.
2. Watch as a grid of colorful dots get created.
3. Click on the screen to exit and close the turtle graphics window.

## Customizing the Painting
- Change the `pic_length` variable to increase or decrease the number of dots in each row and column.
- Adjust the `dot_width` variable to increase or decrease the size of the dots.
- Modify the `space` variable to increase or decrease the space between each dot.

## Educational Value
- **Learning Turtle Graphics**: Great for understanding basic turtle graphics commands.
- **Color Theory in Practice**: See how random colors can be generated and used in Python.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Follows a specific set of steps to create a pattern from simple instructions.
